## Overview

The MCP-DBLP integrates the DBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library Project) API with LLMs through the Model Context Protocol, enabling AI models to:

- Search and retrieve academic publications from the DBLP database
- Process citations and generate BibTeX entries
- Perform fuzzy matching on publication titles and author names
- Extract and format bibliographic information
- Process embedded references in documents
- Direct BibTeX export that bypasses LLM processing for maximum accuracy

## Features

- Comprehensive search capabilities with boolean queries
- Fuzzy title and author name matching
- BibTeX entry retrieval directly from DBLP
- Publication filtering by year and venue
- Statistical analysis of publication data
- Direct BibTeX export capability that bypasses LLM processing for maximum accuracy

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

------

## Installation

1. Install an MCP-compatible client (e.g., [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download))

2. Install the MCP-DBLP:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/mcp-dblp.git
   cd mcp-dblp
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate 
   uv pip install -e .  
   ```

1. Create the configuration file:

   For macOS/Linux:

```
   ~/Library/Application/Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

   For Windows:

```
   %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

   Add the following content:

```
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mcp-dblp": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/absolute/path/to/mcp-dblp/",
           "run",
           "mcp-dblp",
           "--exportdir",
           "/absolute/path/to/bibtex/export/folder/"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
```
Windows: `C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\mcp-dblp`

## Prompt

Included is an [instructions prompt](./instructions_prompt.md) which should be used together with the text containing citations. On Claude Desktop, the instructions prompt is available via the electrical plug icon.


## Tool Details

### search

Search DBLP for publications using a boolean query string.

**Parameters:**

- `query` (string, required): A query string that may include boolean operators 'and' and 'or' (case-insensitive)
- `max_results` (number, optional): Maximum number of publications to return. Default is 10
- `year_from` (number, optional): Lower bound for publication year
- `year_to` (number, optional): Upper bound for publication year
- `venue_filter` (string, optional): Case-insensitive substring filter for publication venues (e.g., 'iclr')
- `include_bibtex` (boolean, optional): Whether to include BibTeX entries in the results. Default is false

### fuzzy_title_search

Search DBLP for publications with fuzzy title matching.

**Parameters:**

- `title` (string, required): Full or partial title of the publication (case-insensitive)
- `similarity_threshold` (number, required): A float between 0 and 1 where 1.0 means an exact match
- `max_results` (number, optional): Maximum number of publications to return. Default is 10
- `year_from` (number, optional): Lower bound for publication year
- `year_to` (number, optional): Upper bound for publication year
- `venue_filter` (string, optional): Case-insensitive substring filter for publication venues
- `include_bibtex` (boolean, optional): Whether to include BibTeX entries in the results. Default is false

### get_author_publications

Retrieve publication details for a specific author with fuzzy matching.

**Parameters:**

- `author_name` (string, required): Full or partial author name (case-insensitive)
- `similarity_threshold` (number, required): A float between 0 and 1 where 1.0 means an exact match
- `max_results` (number, optional): Maximum number of publications to return. Default is 20
- `include_bibtex` (boolean, optional): Whether to include BibTeX entries in the results. Default is false

### get_venue_info

Retrieve detailed information about a publication venue.

**Parameters:**

- `venue_name` (string, required): Venue name or abbreviation (e.g., 'ICLR' or full name)

### calculate_statistics

Calculate statistics from a list of publication results.

**Parameters:**

- `results` (array, required): An array of publication objects, each with at least 'title', 'authors', 'venue', and 'year'

### export_bibtex

Export BibTeX entries directly from DBLP to a local file.

**Parameters:**

- ```
  links
  ```

   

  (string, required): HTML string containing one or more <a href=biburl>key</a> links

  - Example: `"<a href=https://dblp.org/rec/journals/example.bib>Smith2023</a>"`

**Behavior:**

- For each link, the BibTeX entry is fetched directly from DBLP
- Only the citation key is replaced with the key specified in the link text
- All entries are saved to a timestamped .bib file in the folder specified by `--exportdir`
- Returns the full path to the saved file

**Important Note:** The BibTeX entries are fetched directly from DBLP with a 10-second timeout protection and are not processed, modified, or hallucinated by the LLM. This ensures maximum accuracy and trustworthiness of the bibliographic data. Only the citation keys are modified as specified. If a request times out, an error message is included in the output.

## Example

### Input text:

> Our exploration focuses on two types of explanation problems, abductive and contrastive, in local and global contexts (Marques-Silva 2023). Abductive explanations (Ignatiev, Narodytska, and Marques-Silva 2019), corresponding to prime-implicant explanations (Shih, Choi, and Darwiche 2018) and sufficient reason explanations (Darwiche and Ji 2022), clarify specific decision-making instances, while contrastive explanations (Miller 2019; Ignatiev et al. 2020), corresponding to necessary reason explanations (Darwiche and Ji 2022), make explicit the reasons behind the non-selection of alternatives. Conversely, global explanations (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016; Ignatiev, Narodytska, and Marques-Silva 2019) aim to unravel models' decision patterns across various inputs.

### Output text:

> Our exploration focuses on two types of explanation problems, abductive and contrastive, in local and global contexts \cite{MarquesSilvaI23}. Abductive explanations \cite{IgnatievNM19}, corresponding to prime-implicant explanations \cite{ShihCD18} and sufficient reason explanations \cite{DarwicheJ22}, clarify specific decision-making instances, while contrastive explanations \cite{Miller19}; \cite{IgnatievNA020}, corresponding to necessary reason explanations \cite{DarwicheJ22}, make explicit the reasons behind the non-selection of alternatives. Conversely, global explanations \cite{Ribeiro0G16}; \cite{IgnatievNM19} aim to unravel models' decision patterns across various inputs.

### Output Bibtex

> All references have been successfully exported to a BibTeX file at: /absolute/path/to/bibtex/20250305_231431.bib
